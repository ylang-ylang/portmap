# portmap

Branch-scoped network manager for local docker-compose debug environments.

The tool is a control plane, not a traffic proxy. Its default data plane is
Traefik.

It maps branch/worktree instances to generated Docker Compose overlays,
Traefik HTTP labels, Docker direct port mappings, and a CLI-queryable endpoint
registry.

It deliberately does not manage project runtime capability such as GPU,
browser image contents, Playwright workflows, MCP business tools, frontend
performance logic, TURN credentials, ICE config, or application startup policy.
Those belong to the project or the agent workflow.

## Scope

`portmap` manages network variation between branches:

- inspect rendered Docker Compose services, ports, expose entries, and labels
- generate branch-scoped Docker Compose override files
- generate Traefik labels for HTTP endpoints
- generate Docker direct port mappings for raw TCP/UDP and range endpoints
- allocate non-conflicting raw TCP/UDP host ports
- keep per-worktree generated state in `.portmap/state.json`
- keep host-wide raw/range port allocation state in an allocation pool
- write a local endpoint registry for CLI queries
- clean up generated routes, ports, and instance state

`portmap` also provides a shared gateway compose file with Traefik and CoreDNS.
Projects do not need to define their own Traefik service when they use the
generated override.

The project only declares endpoint names, compose service names, and container
internal ports. Existing `ports` and `expose` entries can be treated as endpoint
candidates.

## Non-goals

- no host-network mode selection
- no GPU or desktop runtime management
- no HTTP/TCP/UDP proxy implementation
- no TURN credential or ICE config management
- no business-flow orchestration
- no test selector or performance-analysis logic

## Minimal Endpoint Declaration

```toml
[endpoints.frontend]
kind = "http"
service = "frontend"
container_port = 5173

# Optional. HTTP endpoints rewrite upstream Host by default.
# Set this when the service must see the external Host header.
preserve_host = true

[endpoints.mqtt]
kind = "tcp"
service = "mqtt"
container_port = 1883

[endpoints.turn_udp]
kind = "udp"
service = "coturn"
container_port = 3478
```

From that declaration the tool can generate:

- `docker-compose.override.generated.yml`
- `state.json` for this branch/worktree's generated compose project and endpoints
- raw TCP/UDP allocation state only when raw endpoints need host ports

For HTTP-only projects, `.portmap/` can stay minimal:

```text
.portmap/
  endpoints.toml
  docker-compose.override.generated.yml
  state.json
```

The running service catalog is derived from Docker labels at the shared
gateway, so project-local registry files are not required for HTTP endpoints.

HTTP endpoints default to rewriting the upstream `Host` header to
`127.0.0.1:<container_port>`. This makes strict local debug services such as
Chromium CDP accept requests that entered through external debug domains. If an
application needs the original external Host, set `preserve_host = true` for
that endpoint. If a service needs a specific upstream Host, set
`upstream_host = "host:port"`.

## CLI

Install the local checkout as a `uv` tool so other repos can call the short
`portmap` command:

```bash
uv tool install --editable /home/ylang/ylangs_ws/portmap@wt/portmap@dev --force
```

Start the shared gateway once:

```bash
portmap gateway up -d
```

This creates the `portmap_gateway` Docker network and exposes:

```text
Catalog: http://<detected-host-ip>
Traefik: http://<detected-host-ip>:8080
DNS:     <detected-host-ip>:53
```

CoreDNS answers every `*.debug.lan` A record with the detected host LAN IP.
Other DNS queries are forwarded to the configured upstream resolver, defaulting
to `/etc/resolv.conf`, so portmap-managed containers can still resolve public
domains after their DNS is pointed at portmap. Configure development machines
with split DNS so only `debug.lan` queries go to this DNS server.

Gateway runtime settings are tracked in the portmap repo root:

```text
portmap.toml
```

`portmap gateway` reads that file directly and detects the current host LAN IP
at runtime. The detected IP is used for DNS answers and raw/range endpoint
advertisement, so the LAN IP does not need to be stored in config.

Configure split DNS on a Linux development machine without manually looking up
the network interface:

```bash
DNS_SERVER=<detected-host-ip>
DNS_DOMAIN=debug.lan
DNS_IFACE="$(ip route get "$DNS_SERVER" | awk '{for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) if ($i == "dev") {print $(i + 1); exit}}')"

sudo resolvectl dns "$DNS_IFACE" "$DNS_SERVER"
sudo resolvectl domain "$DNS_IFACE" "~$DNS_DOMAIN"
resolvectl query "portmap.$DNS_DOMAIN"
curl -I "http://portmap.$DNS_DOMAIN/"
```

The catalog page lists currently visible `portmap`/Traefik-managed services and
their generated endpoints. Each visible compose project also has a `Down`
button that removes its portmap-managed Docker Compose containers and networks
by compose project label, which is useful when a worktree/repo path has moved.
The JSON form is available at:

```text
http://<detected-host-ip>/registry.json
```

Generate files for an external compose project:

```bash
cd /path/to/project
portmap init
```

This creates:

```text
.portmap/
  endpoints.toml
  README.md
  .gitignore
```

`.portmap/README.md` explains how to make a docker-compose repo portmap-managed:
use Docker bridge networking for managed services, declare endpoint kinds in
`endpoints.toml`, generate a branch-specific compose override, start compose
with that override, and query the shared catalog for the assigned URLs and raw
ports.

After editing `.portmap/endpoints.toml`, the recommended path is to let the
Docker Compose broker regenerate files automatically:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The broker can also be called explicitly without shell integration:

```bash
portmap docker-compose -- up -d
```

For manual generation, `portmap generate` defaults to the current directory
when paths are omitted:

```bash
portmap generate \
  --compose-file docker-compose.yml \
  --config .portmap/endpoints.toml \
  --out-dir .portmap \
  --branch "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

For transparent `docker compose ...` takeover, install the Docker Compose
plugin shim. This works for interactive shells, scripts, and non-interactive
agents such as Codex because it does not rely on `.zshrc` or shell functions:

```bash
portmap broker install --method docker-plugin
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

The shim is installed at:

```text
~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-compose
```

Docker CLI will call that plugin for `docker compose ...`. The shim forwards
Docker plugin metadata to the real Compose plugin, strips Docker's plugin
environment before forwarding, and calls `portmap docker-compose -- ...` only
when takeover is enabled and the current directory contains `.portmap`.

Inspect or remove the shim:

```bash
portmap broker status
portmap broker uninstall
```

Safety switches:

```text
PORTMAP_COMPOSE_TAKEOVER=0  # disable takeover, forward to real compose
PORTMAP_BROKER_BYPASS=1     # internal bypass to avoid recursive shim calls
```

The broker auto-generates `.portmap/docker-compose.override.generated.yml` and
`.portmap/state.json` when `.portmap/endpoints.toml` exists. It also injects a
branch/worktree-scoped compose project name unless the command already provides
`-p/--project-name`.

`state.json` is local to this worktree. The host-wide raw/range port pool is a
separate file, defaulting to:

```text
~/.local/state/portmap/allocations.json
```

That allocation pool is shared so two branches cannot automatically pick the
same host port before either container has bound it.

The generated override adds managed services to `portmap_gateway` and writes
Traefik Docker labels. The shared Traefik container discovers those labels
through the Docker socket.

Query the shared catalog:

```bash
curl http://<detected-host-ip>/registry.json
portmap list
portmap status
portmap endpoints my-repo dev
```

## Catalog Frontend

The catalog UI is a Vite + React app. Source files live under:

```text
frontend/
```

Install frontend dependencies once:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the frontend dev server with hot reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the frontend with built-in mock catalog data:

```bash
PORTMAP_CATALOG_MOCK=1 npm run dev
```

Run the same mock UI from Docker Compose on host port `81`:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.mock.yml up
```

Then open:

```text
http://<host-ip>:81/
```

By default the Vite server proxies `/registry.json`, `/actions/*`, `/healthz`,
and `/readyz` to the catalog service at `http://127.0.0.1:80`. Override that
target when the catalog is exposed somewhere else:

```bash
PORTMAP_CATALOG_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:8081 npm run dev
```

Build the frontend into the Python package static directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output is tracked in:

```text
src/portmap/catalog_static/
```

## Integration Test Repo

The repo includes a Python-managed integration fixture that creates a real Git
worktree-style compose repo under the ignored `test_repo/` directory:

```text
test_repo/
  mock-compose-app@wt/
    mock-compose-app@main
    mock-compose-app@dev
    mock-compose-app@feat-all-endpoints
  gateway/
```

The generated mock app has separate branches/worktrees and endpoint kinds:

```text
dev                -> HTTP endpoint
feat/all-endpoints -> HTTP, TCP, UDP, and range endpoints
```

Run ordinary unit tests:

```bash
uv run --with pytest pytest
```

Run the real Docker response test:

```bash
PORTMAP_RUN_INTEGRATION=1 uv run --with pytest pytest tests/test_integration_test_repo.py -q
```

That integration test starts a temporary Traefik gateway and both worktree
instances, then verifies actual HTTP, TCP, UDP, and range UDP responses with
Python clients. The generated `test_repo/` directory is ignored by git and can
be deleted at any time; the test will recreate it.
